As a data scientist, the volume of tools and resources that are being produced in the field, and the velocity of which they are evolving is simply astounding. Every day we have a new toolkit or novel technique in working with data. 

But how much of these advancements are actually benefiting people and organizations who wants to solve real-world problems they are facing? 

As a data scientist, I have seen many cases where people are stuck at the beginning: how should I translate my issue into a data problem? In other words, how should I measure the phenomenon of interest, collect relevant data and apply appropriate tools and techniques?

Measurement can be defined as the quantification of real-world phenomenon into numbers. In some cases there are familiar measures such as age or temperature, but oftentimes defining an appropriate measure is a non-trivial issue.
