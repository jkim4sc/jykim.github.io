Since the term ‘data science’ has existed only for about five years, there would be almost no one who grew up with the childhood dream of becoming a data scientist. I also started to introduce myself as a data scientist only for a few years, although the possi bility of data has enchanted me since my teen years, and I have continuously tried to collect and make use of data for a long time.

The short lifespan of data science means that there are not many established role models in becoming a data scientist. In a sense, everyone in the field is working while figuring out what it is. However, I believe that hearing of stories from those who started a bit earlier can still inform newcomers of what to do, or what not to do. 

Here’s a story of how a data scientist is made…

### Data Science for College Entrance Exam

Since childhood, I had a tendency to record facts and emotions. This is partly due to bad short-term memory, but I also have enjoyed the feeling of accumulating something over time, be it a journal, or a list of books I read. Sometimes these records made me proud, but more often I could find something I need to improve. Looking back, even as a child I had certain urge to collect data out of everything I was doing.

Then there came a time where I had the first major goal in life: going to a good college. Students in South Korea are known for their fierce competition to enter good schools, and I was no exception. 

Since virtually all of my time was spent in studying for various exams, I naturally started to record various things about how I study. This included the time I spent on different activities (reading, writing, problem solving) and subjects (math, English, science), as well as what type of problems I get right or wrong once I take a quiz. 

Remember that this is mid 90s where desktop computer were spreading, but virtually no one was using emails yet. While I was happy to use a grid paper for all my statistics and charts, I can imagine students of today can do the same thing much easily using a smartphone apps.

I wasn’t aware at that point, but I was effectively practicing data-driven method for studying. I tried to make sure I spent enough time on each activity and subject based on time statistics. Since I knew exact where my weakest points were, I could focus more efforts on those areas.

My school grades keep rising throughout my high school years, largely due to data-driven innovations. I’ve found time and place I was most productive at, and I kept improving how I study for a subject and prepare for an exam. While most Korean students rely on private institution, I decided to study on my own knowing that I can figure out the method that works best for me. Eventually I entered the most prestigious school, but more importantly I learned the value of data and data-driven innovations.

### Eye-opening Possibility of Technology

I started to spend a lot of time attending CS courses although my major was EE. I realized that I liked to build something (i.e., software) that directly interface with a user , as opposed to something (i.e., hardware) that interface with a software. I was especially impressed by the ability of computer and internet that makes large amount of information accessible anywhere, and started to build a web-based tool for managing my schedule.

For the next 3 years, while working for a software company in Korea as a substitute for military service, I kept on improving the system, dubbed ‘MYLEO(Make Your Life ExtraOrdinary)’. MYLEO started as a simple calendar, but I added a feature where I can rate my schedule on a scale of A to F. The goal was to notice and improve what was unsatisfactory about my daily activities, in the same way I tried to optimize my studying routine during high school years.

I kept adding various features to the tool, including fancy (at least so I thought) visualization for category-level breakdown of scores. I also added Wiki-like knowledge management system where I tracked what I learned. My colleagues called me crazy, because I was working every night to improve the tool. But they started to suggest various new features, and several of them eventually adopted the system for their personal information.

Having spent 3 years developing MYLEO, I was ready to bet my career on the potential of information technology and data-driven innovation. While I learned a lot while iterating on the software myself, I also realized that I needed to learn a lot more to start a serious career in the field. I started to look for graduate programs in the field of information management and retrieval, and got admission for Computer Science MS/Ph.D program in the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
